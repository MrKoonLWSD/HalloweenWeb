Beginner Puzzles: HTML & CSS Basics
These puzzles focus on fundamental web development concepts:
"Build a Pumpkin" with <div>s: Challenge learners to use HTML <div> elements and CSS properties like background-color, border-radius, and positioning (position: absolute;) to construct a jack-o'-lantern face. They can use different divs for the eyes, nose, and mouth.
"Haunted House Structure": Provide an image of a haunted house and ask the user to replicate its structure using HTML5 semantic elements like <header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, and <article>.
"Ghostly Message Decryption" (CSS Styling): Give users a page with a hidden message (e.g., text with color: white; on a white background). The puzzle is to use their browser's developer tools or a CSS file to find and change the CSS property that makes the "ghostly" message visible.
"Spooky Styling": Provide a basic, unstyled HTML page with Halloween content (text and images). The challenge is to apply a "spooky" theme using CSS, including dark backgrounds, eerie fonts from Google Fonts, and appropriate colors (orange, purple, green). 
Intermediate Puzzles: Interactivity & Effects
These puzzles introduce JavaScript or more advanced CSS techniques:
"The Doorbell of Doom": Create an interactive puzzle where a user must click different elements (e.g., a "doorbell" button) in a specific order to reveal a "trick" or "treat" message. This involves using JavaScript event listeners (addEventListener) and manipulating the DOM elements, such as changing their display properties or text content (innerHTML).
"Toggle the Lights": Build a web page where a "light switch" button can be toggled on and off. When the lights are off, the background turns black, a ghost graphic appears, and spooky audio plays, requiring JavaScript to manage multiple state changes.
"Dripping Blood Effect" (CSS Animation): Challenge users to create a dripping effect (e.g., blood from a title) using advanced CSS techniques like pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) and keyframe animations.
"Escape the Infinite Loop": A logic-based coding puzzle where the user must identify and fix an error in a JavaScript function that has created an unintended infinite loop, preventing the page from loading correctly. 
Advanced Challenges
"Haunted Scene" (HTML/CSS only): A code challenge to create an entire interactive and animated Halloween scene (e.g., glowing pumpkins, a haunted mansion with creaking doors) using only HTML and CSS, pushing the limits of CSS animations and transitions.
"Monster Battle Simulator": An advanced challenge to build a simple game interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the user inputs actions to battle a "monster," involving string manipulation, loops, and conditional logic. 
These puzzles can be hosted on platforms like CodePen or GitHub Pages, and users can submit their solutions for review or community voting
